st.write("""
    This is a prototype of a search engine for phenotypes. It uses the OpenAI API to embed phenotypes and Pinecone to index them. The search engine is
    currently limited to the phenotypes in the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO).

    Take a visual look at our disease universe here: https://atlas.nomic.ai/map/8f94a626-f4c2-4722-a8f9-025654e47c47/06f74b36-a1f3-4850-a955-e36c875b06dd

    Our goal is to provide a tool that helps researchers to:
    - **Uncover new mechanistic insights**. Identification of new molecular pathways that are involved in the disease, and which may be potential drug targets.
    - **Uncover new disease biomarkers**. Identification of molecules or patterns tart are over-represented in the presence of disease. 
    - **Analysis of gene to phenotype signals within a context**. Identification and subtyping of diseases help in the interpretation of already known gene to phenotype signals, instead of treating all associations in an isolated manner.
